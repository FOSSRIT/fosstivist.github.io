# Our Pledge

We, the undersigned, are employees of technology organizations and companies around the world.  We participate in managing, designing, and generally creating software with relation to AI systems. We acknowledge the threat of deploying far-reaching AI systems and the impact it has upon all of us, including the world's most vulnerable populations. With this pledge, we affirm our commitment to a future that respects and protects our essential Freedoms.

We believe that all are entitled to the following Freedoms when subjected to AI systems:

- The ability to audit automated decision-making systems.
- Demand accountability & responsibility from those who make AI systems.
- Appeal decisions made by AI systems.

We pledge to accept nothing less than the Freedoms stated above. In order to fight to protect these freedoms, we commit to the following actions:

- AI systems we contribute to building are reproducible in their original form.
    - We will release our code containing our model under Free licenses.
    - We will release our training data sets under open licenses.
    - We will provide adequate documentation for others to reasonably set up and audit our code.
- AI systems are responsibly designed by performing and publishing impact and risk assessments with regards to what we create and the side effects it may have.
- Decisions made by our AI systems can be appealed to provide additional human input & context.

We, as creators of AI systems, pledge to respect the Freedoms of our end users. We pledge to push for accountability within the organizations in which we work. Too much damage has been done already by organizations who have placed profit over the Freedom of their users, customers, and fellow humans. We pledge to work towards sustainable, ethical AI systems, to speak up for our Freedoms, and to stand against placing personal interest over our fellow humans.
